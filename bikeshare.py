#Credits: Pandas Documentation was SUPER helpful when dealing with combining two columsn and applying functions like mode.
#Credits: Additionally, github repos of xhlow and philribbens were helpful in exploring different structures to the same problem statement.
#Credits: Udacity's 3 Problems in this project, namely user type, load data and popular hour, were immensely helpful.
#Credits: Final credit goes to my college classes, econometrics courses and professors and familiarity with R programming.
